### Used Technologies 
ReactJS - main technology
  - useState -  used to add a state variable to the components. On change of the variable the component would re-render.
  - useEffect - used to perform specific operations on component initialization or synchronize a component with an external system /change of props, states or context variables/
  - useContext - used to read and subscribe to context. In the project we have two global contexts: "Notification" and "Cart". 
  - useCallback - used to cache a function definition between re-renders
React-Router - handles the page routing
Styled-Components - create a simple and reusable CSS components that are used throughout the application. Media queries have been used to create the responsive and mobile version.
Resuite - used in the filter section for the price slider
React-Helmet-Async - used for SEO optimization. More specifically in my case it handles the page titles and meta description.
React-Icons - used for "menu", "filter", "close" and "cart" icons
Firebase-Tools - for setting, initializing and deploying the project to firebase.
