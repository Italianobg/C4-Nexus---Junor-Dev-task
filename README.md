### Used Technologies 
ReactJS - main technology<br/>
  - useState -  used to add a state variable to the components. On change of the variable the component would re-render.<br/>
  - useEffect - used to perform specific operations on component initialization or synchronize a component with an external system /change of props, states or context variables/<br/>
  - useContext - used to read and subscribe to context. In the project we have two global contexts: "Notification" and "Cart". <br/>
  - useCallback - used to cache a function definition between re-renders<br/><br/>
React-Router - handles the page routing<br/>
Styled-Components - create a simple and reusable CSS components that are used throughout the application. Media queries have been used to create the responsive and mobile version.<br/>
Resuite - used in the filter section for the price slider<br/>
React-Helmet-Async - used for SEO optimization. More specifically in my case it handles the page titles and meta description.<br/>
React-Icons - used for "menu", "filter", "close" and "cart" icons<br/>
Firebase-Tools - for setting, initializing and deploying the project to firebase.<br/>
